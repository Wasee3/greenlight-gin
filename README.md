# Greenlight Gin REST API

Recently, I read a book about writing APIs in Go using the `net/http` framework.

It was a wonderful book that helped me learn a lot. I implemented a REST API in Go at work, leveraging the knowledge gained.

Although that book was based on a different web library framework, I decided to adapt that framework to the **Gin Web Framework**.

I've tried to use a number of **production-grade microservice tools** just for illustration purposes.

## üöÄ Tools Used:
- **Gin** (Web Framework)
- **GORM** (ORM for interacting with Postgres DB)
- **Postgres** (Database)
- **Keycloak** (Identity Provider)
- **Consul** (Service Registry)
- **Registrator** (Dynamic Discovery)
- **slog** (Structured Logging)
- **Prometheus Client** (Metrics)
- **OpenTelemetry** (Emitting Traces)
- **Jaeger** (APM)
